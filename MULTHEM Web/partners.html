                The Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) is a mission-driven Research and Technology Organization (RTO) that develops 
                competitive and market-oriented product/service prototypes for public and private stakeholders. With its 600 employees, 75% of whom are 
                researchers or innovation experts from all around the world, LIST is active in the fields of informatics, materials and environment and 
                works across the entire innovation chain: fundamental/applied research, incubation, and transfer of technologies. Through its research 
                into advanced materials and processes, the “Materials Research and Technology” (MRT) department, with its 200 researchers and engineers,
                contributes to the emergence of enabling technologies that underpin the innovation processes of local and international industry. MRT’s 
                activities hinge on four thematic pillars: nanomaterials and nanotechnology, scientific instrumentation and process technology, structural 
                composites, and functional polymers. The functional polymers unit will develop new conductive composites and evaluate recycling methods 
                for the materials used in the case studies in MULTHEM.

                Brightlands Materials Center (BM) is a TNO joint innovation center in partnership with the Province of Limburg. BMC develops circular 
                and lightweight solutions for mobility markets based on thermoplastic composite materials and technologies. BMC focuses on technologies 
                and materials for structural, lightweight and freeform components for mobility markets and on recycling of thermoplastic composites and 
                re-application of recycled materials. Our Continuous Fiber Additive Manufacturing (composite 3D printing) development is aimed at 
                manufacturing thermoplastic composite structural components with high mechanical strength-to-weight ratio in complex shapes. Unique 
                design optimalization and parts integration allows for additional weight savings. Our unique and proprietary Recycling Technology for 
                thermoplastic composite materials keeps the good mechanical properties of composites by retaining fiber length. We develop recycled 
                composite materials (e.g. Long Fiber Thermoplastics) and do application development to re-use these recycled materials in high-end 
                applications. Brightlands Materials Center offers services to the industry both through bilateral contract research and through industry 
                collaborations in (subsidized) consortia.
